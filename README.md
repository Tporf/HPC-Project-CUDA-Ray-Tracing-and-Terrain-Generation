# HPC Project: CUDA Ray Tracing and Terrain Generation

## Languages Used

- **CUDA C++**  
  Core kernels implementation for high-performance tasks such as terrain generation and ray tracing leveraging GPU massive parallelism.  
  Example: CUDA ray tracer from [NVIDIA blog](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/accelerated-ray-tracing-cuda/) and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Ancientkingg/cuda-raytracer)[1][2].

- **C++ / OpenGL (optional)**  
  For interactive demos and real-time rendering, integrating CUDA computations with OpenGL graphics pipeline.

- **Python**  
  Used for configuring parameters, running benchmarks, and plotting performance results to analyze and tune HPC applications.

## Key HPC Concepts

### Massive Parallelism in CUDA Kernels

- CUDA executes thousands of lightweight threads organized in blocks and grids.
- Each thread handles one or more pixels or computation units (e.g., rays in ray tracing).
- Example: GPU ray tracing kernel launching one thread per pixel for parallel ray-scene intersection[1][2].

### Memory Management

- **Global Memory:** Large but high latency; minimize accesses and coalesce memory reads/writes.
- **Shared Memory:** Fast on-chip memory shared by threads in the same block; use for data reuse and reducing global memory traffic.
- **Constant Memory:** Cached read-only memory for frequently used constants (e.g., scene parameters).
- Proper memory hierarchy usage is critical for performance[6].

### CPU vs GPU Comparison

- Implement CPU baseline with OpenMP for parallelism.
- Compare performance and scalability against CUDA GPU implementation.
- Example: CPU ray tracing vs CUDA ray tracing with speedups often 10x or more[1][6].

### Profiling and Optimization

- Use NVIDIA Nsight Systems and Nsight Compute to profile kernels.
- Identify bottlenecks such as memory bandwidth, occupancy, and divergent branches.
- Optimize kernel launch configuration, memory access patterns, and use asynchronous data transfers.
